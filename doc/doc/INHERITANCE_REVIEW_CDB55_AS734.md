##Part 1

* What is an implementation decision that your design is encapsulating (i.e., hiding) for other areas of the program?
* What inheritance hierarchies are you intending to build within your area and what behavior are they based around?
* What parts within your area are you trying to make closed and what parts open to take advantage of this polymorphism you are creating?
* What exceptions (error cases) might occur in your area and how will you handle them (or not, by throwing)?
* Why do you think your design is good (also define what your measure of good is)?

##Part 2
* How is your area linked to/dependent on other areas of the project?
* Are these dependencies based on the other class's behavior or implementation?
* How can you minimize these dependencies?
* Go over one pair of super/sub classes in detail to see if there is room for improvement. 
* Focus on what things they have in common (these go in the superclass) and what about them varies (these go in the subclass).

##Part 3

* Come up with at least five use cases for your part (most likely these will be useful for both teams).
* What feature/design problem are you most excited to work on?
* What feature/design problem are you most worried about working on?
